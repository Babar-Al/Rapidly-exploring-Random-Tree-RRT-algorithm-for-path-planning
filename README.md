# Rapidly-exploring-Random-Tree-RRT-algorithm-for-path-planning
This project implements the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm for path planning in a 2D space with obstacles. Given a grayscale map (e.g., an aerial or occupancy grid), the algorithm computes a path from a start point to a goal point, avoiding obstacles.
